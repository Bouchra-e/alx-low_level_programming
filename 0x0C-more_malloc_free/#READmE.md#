task0
write a function that allocates memory using malloc
- prototype: void *malloc_checked(unsigned int b)
- return a ponter to the allocated lelory
- if malloc fails, the malloc_checked funtion should cause normal process termination with a status value of 98

task 1
write a function that concatenates two strings 
-protype : char *string_nconcat(char *s1, char *s2, unsigned int n);
-they returned pointer shall point to newly allocated space in memory, which s1, followed by the firt n bytes of s2, and null terminated 
-if the function fails, it should be return NULL 
-if n is greater or equal to th length of s2 then use the entire string s2
-NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string 

task 2
write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc 
-prototype: void *_calloc (unsigned int nmemb, unsigned int sze);
-the
